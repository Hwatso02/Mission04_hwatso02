<h4>What do I hope to get from IS 413:</h4>
<p>
    I would love to hopefully feel better and more comfortable coding in a laguage,
    as I have yet to really like or feel good about coding in any language up to this point.
    I've been able to manage and get through my classes and understand it to the bare minimum,
    but not enough that I have any interest in any sort of coding once I graduate. Another thing
    that would be useful to gain from this class is a better knowledge of how to use the debugger
    to determine breaking points in code I write rather than spending hours trying to Google or stare at syntax.
